
UMS app can run in any computers which has a MySQL sever...

	-> This App will autometically create the database and tables needed in your hard disk.


If it shows "Client does not support authentication protocol requested by server; consider upgrading MySQL client" message then,

	-> Execute the following query in MYSQL Workbench or other MySQL Applicaton.

		> ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'password'

	-> Where root as your user localhost as your URL and password as your password

	-> Then run this query to refresh privileges:

		> flush privileges;

	-> Try connecting using node after you do so.

	-> If that doesn't work, try it without @'localhost' part.
